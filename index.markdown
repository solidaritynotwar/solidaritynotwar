description: Tech workers for solidarity not war
---

We are a group of tech workers who have come together to build bonds of solidarity between people in our industries in the UK and our peers who are impacted by Russiaâ€™s brutal war against Ukraine.

Our initial goals are:
- To make contacts among the Ukrainian tech community and with Russian anti-war tech workers
- To encourage the creation of literature so that refugees and exiles from the war are informed about their employment rights in the UK
- Within our trade unions, to encourage them to offer a period of discounted or free membership to those who've fled the conflict and are seeking work in our industries

Tech Workers for Solidarity not War has supporters working in a broad range of industries and disciplines including software, IT, video games and digital media.
