# Information sheet for Ukrainian refugees
### Introduction

This information sheet is aimed at people who have taken refuge from the
war in the United Kingdom and are trying to find employment in the tech
sector.

### Who we are

*Tech Workers for Solidarity not War* is a group of tech workers who
have come together to build bonds of solidarity between people in our
industries in the UK and our peers who are impacted by Russia's brutal
war against Ukraine.

Our initial goals are:

-   To make contacts among the Ukrainian tech community and with Russian
anti-war tech workers

-   To encourage the creation of literature so that refugees and exiles
from the war are informed about their employment rights in the UK

-   Within our trade unions, to encourage them to offer a period of
discounted or free membership to those who've fled the conflict
and are seeking work in our industries

Tech Workers for Solidarity not War has supporters working in a broad
range of industries and disciplines including software, IT, video games
and digital media. We are members of two UK tech unions: [IWGB Game
Workers](https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/) and [Unite London
Digital & Tech](https://www.unitedigitaltech.org/)

### Writing your CV

If you would like assistance in making sure your CV (curriculum vitae,
sometimes called a résumé) is suitable for the type of job you're
applying for in the UK, or if you need help creating a new CV, then
please contact us at [twfsnw@gmail.com](mailto:twfsnw@gmail.com)
and we'll do our best to help you.

### Looking for a job

-   Here is quite a good
[list](https://www.itpro.co.uk/business-strategy/careers-training/355967/14-best-job-boards-for-tech)
of tech job websites. There are also many agencies specialising in
tech which you can find with a Google search.

-   If you work in the games industry, you can also use
[jobs.gamesindustry.biz](https://jobs.gamesindustry.biz/)
and [gamesjobsdirect.com](https://www.gamesjobsdirect.com/)
to search for suitable jobs.

-   [linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/) is used heavily by
recruitment agents to find candidates for jobs so you might think
about creating a profile there.

-   [glassdoor.co.uk](https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/) is a job site
on which employees can write reviews of companies, so can be
useful in finding out what employees think of the firm.

-   Some of our union members are part of co-operatives (worker-owned
companies). If you're interested in working for a co-op you can
check out [coops.tech](https://www.coops.tech/).

### Your rights at work

The most useful website for understanding your rights at work is
[acas.org.uk](https://www.acas.org.uk/). It contains good basic
advice for both employees and employers.

Additionally, [Citizens
Advice](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/) contains useful
information about employment rights and many other areas, as well as
offering walk-in centres where volunteers are able to provide help and
support on a range of issues.

### Trade Union membership

We believe that being a trade union member is the best way to ensure
your rights at work are protected and that your pay and terms and
conditions are defended. Here are some facts about trade union
membership in the UK:

-   In the UK people join trade unions on an individual basis. In some
countries you can only join a union if one exists in a workplace,
but that is not the case in the UK.

-   You don't have to tell an employer that you are a member, and we
would advise not to do so. The union will not tell them without
your approval. Whether someone is a trade union member is
considered sensitive data and is [protected by
law](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/lawful-basis-for-processing/special-category-data/).

-   As a trade union member you have a number of basic protections:

    -   Protection against detriment (damage or disadvantage) for being
    a member of a trade union.

    -   Protection against detriment for taking part in trade union
    activities outside work hours, for example attending a union
    event.

    -   Protection against detriment for utilising the services of a
    trade union

    -   Right to be accompanied by a trade union representative in
    grievance and disciplinary meetings.

-   Where the company recognises a union (accepts the union as having
the right to negotiate with the employer on behalf of members over
pay, holiday, etc), members may have further rights. For example,
to attend union meetings during work hours.
